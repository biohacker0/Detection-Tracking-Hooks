## Introduction

This collection of custom hooks provides convenient solutions to common problems faced in web development when working with React applications. Each hook serves a specific purpose and can be easily integrated into your project to enhance user experience and developer productivity.

## Installation

To use these custom hooks in your React project, you can simply copy the hook files (`useCopyDetection.js`, `useErrorTracking.js`, `usePrintDetection.js`, `usePageViewTracking.js`, `useTimeSpentOnPage.js`) into your project's directory. Make sure to adjust the import paths according to your project structure.

## Usage

### useCopyDetection

This hook detects when text is copied on the webpage and invokes a callback function with the copied text as a parameter.

```javascript
import { useState } from 'react';
import useCopyDetection from './useCopyDetection';

const App = () => {
  const handleCopy = (copiedText) => {
    console.log("Copied text:", copiedText);
    // Perform actions with the copied text
  };
  useCopyDetection(handleCopy);

  return (
    // Your JSX components
  );
};

```
